# Tinderbox_drought

Repository to share code used for analyses of the 2017-19 Tinderbox Drought in southeast Australia

Please add the a line in this readme file about the code you commit along the lines of 'file_name.R - used to calculate SPI3'

1. impact based drought indicator/ML_Database_All_AWRA_MOf_and_3MPrecip - used to train machine learning model

2. drought_metrics/sp*_calc_gridded* - used to calculate SPI-3 and SPEI-3

3. drought_metrics/plot_drought_focusReg_meanSPI.ipynb & drought_metrics/plot_drought_focusReg_meanSPEI.ipynb - used to create spatial plot of mean SPI-3 and SPEI-3

4. water_cycle_analysis/precipitation_and_ET_monthly_plots.ipynb - used to plot monthly anomalies in precipitation and ET (first panel of Figure 2) & save the anomaly numbers in csv files

5. soil_moisture_drought_impact_on_summer_temperature.py - used to plot difference map of soil drought impact on summer temperature
